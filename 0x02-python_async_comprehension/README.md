Tasks
0. Async Generator
mandatory
Write a coroutine called async_generator that takes no arguments.

The coroutine will loop 10 times, each time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number between 0 and 10. Use the random module.

1. Async Comprehensions
mandatory
Import async_generator from the previous task and then write a coroutine called async_comprehension that takes no arguments.

The coroutine will collect 10 random numbers using an async comprehensing over async_generator, then return the 10 random numbers.

2. Run time for four parallel comprehensions
mandatory
Import async_comprehension from the previous file and write a measure_runtime coroutine that will execute async_comprehension four times in parallel using asyncio.gather.

measure_runtime should measure the total runtime and return it.

Notice that the total runtime is roughly 10 seconds, explain it to yourself.
